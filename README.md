# ts-playground

This is a projet that I use as a baseline when I need to quicky test small typescript code, or when geeking on codewars.com

## Scripts

### dev

```bash
    npm run dev
```

This executes the code from `./src/dev.ts` file with a file watcher.

### test

```bash
    npm run test
```

This runs all tests found in the project with file watcher.

I usually only work with `./src/solution.ts` (code file) and `./src/test/solution.test.ts` (test file)
